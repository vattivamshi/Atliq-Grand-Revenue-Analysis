## My Approach

This project was built as a **portfolio piece** to sharpen my BI storytelling skills and explore real-world hospitality metrics. Here's a quick breakdown of what I did:

* Cleaned and transformed raw datasets in Power BI.
* Built custom **DAX measures** to calculate performance metrics, revenue KPIs, booking behaviour, occupancy and more.
* Structured the dashboard into three intuitive sections:

  * **Home Overview**
  * **Performance Overview**
  * **Revenue Leakage Analysis**

I focused on **usability, clarity and insight** â€”making sure stakeholders could immediately understand what's working well and where attention is needed.

## Visual Design

To clearly differentiate between the two analytical lenses:

* **Performance Overview** uses calming **green, cream, and earthy brown** shades to emphasize growth and success.
* **Revenue Leakage** employs **shades of red and grey**, subtly highlighting critical areas without overwhelming the viewer.

---

## Key DAX Measures Used

A wide range of DAX measures were created to drive the dashboard metrics, such as:

* Revenue & Revenue Loss calculations
* Occupancy Rate & RevPAR
* Cancellation %, No-Show Rate, Realization %
* Booking % by Room Class and Platform
* High vs. Low Rating Count
* Day Type (Weekday vs Weekend)

Each was created to deliver targeted insights for specific business questions, improving strategic decision-making for AtliQ Grands.

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways

This dashboard gives hotel executives:

* A snapshot of **whatâ€™s working**â€”top revenue sources, peak-performing platforms, and optimal room classes.
* A diagnosis of **whatâ€™s not working**â€”cancelation trends, low-rated platforms, underperforming locations.

By placing **revenue gain and loss side-by-side**, decision-makers get a complete picture to guide **both growth and recovery strategies**.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

I cleaned and transformed the data, modelled it using a star schema with proper fact and dimension tables, and built out complex DAX measures to power the visuals.

As someone who enjoys combining **storytelling, business context  and visuals**, this was a fun and challenging project to simulate a real-world corporate scenario.

This dashboard is a small piece of what strategic data analytics can achieve in the hospitality spaceâ€”and I look forward to building more like this across different industries.
